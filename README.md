# grocery-bud

Will learn how to update and delete items from a grocery list and create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application.

CRUD plays a very important role in developing full stack applications. 

Without it, you wouldn't be able to do things like edit or delete posts on your favorite social media platform.  

Key concepts covered:

DOMContentLoaded

new Date()

createAttribute()

setAttributeNode()

appendChild()

filter()

map()
